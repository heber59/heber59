# Hi, I'm Heber 👋

Front-end Developer specialized in **React**, **TypeScript** and building clean, scalable and maintainable interfaces.

I’ve worked mainly on **enterprise applications and internal design-system libraries**, where most of the code lives inside the company.  
To complement that, I’m publishing selected projects and reusable component libraries publicly.

My focus: **UI engineering, component architecture, design systems and developer experience (DX)**.

## 🔍 What I do

- Build and architect **front-end applications** using React + TypeScript  
- Create **reusable, accessible and scalable UI components**  
- Implement **design systems** using tools like Storybook  
- Set up **tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, commitlint  
- Work with **REST APIs**, routing, state management and custom hooks  
- Collaborate through GitHub, code reviews and clean development workflows

## 📦 Public NPM Packages (UI & Business Logic Libraries)

I’ve worked on a set of **enterprise-grade front-end libraries** published under the `@isettingkit` namespace.  
These packages are part of a modular architecture that separates **business rules**, **form logic**, and **UI components**, enabling scalable and maintainable applications.

All libraries are published on NPM and documented using Storybook or internal documentation.

> *(READMEs belong to the organization and cannot be modified, but the code reflects real work in reusable component architecture, validation systems and UI foundations.)*

---

### **1. `@isettingkit/business-rules` – Business Rules Engine**
Core library for handling business rules and dynamic decision logic.

Includes:
- Schema definition for rules and conditions  
- Dynamic evaluation logic  
- Validation layers  
- Abstractions for decision trees and rule groups  

🔗 NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@isettingkit/business-rules

---

### **2. `@isettingkit/input` – Input Components & Form Logic**
Library of reusable, typed input components used across multiple products.

Includes:
- Input architecture with TypeScript typings  
- Validation logic  
- Consistent props API across components  
- Integration with rule engines and dynamic forms  

🔗 NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@isettingkit/input

---

### **3. `@isettingkit/view` – UI Views & Presentation Layer**
Presentation components and view-level abstractions.

Includes:
- UI wrapper components  
- Layout primitives  
- Reusable views that integrate with `@isettingkit/input`  
- Theming and structure for consistent front-end experiences  

🔗 NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@isettingkit/view

## 🌱 Currently working on

- Developing front-end applications and UI architecture at **Inube**, focusing on reusable components, design-system consistency and scalable TypeScript patterns  
- Publishing a **modern personal landing page** to showcase UI, animations and component work  
- Building **open-source reusable components** with full documentation (Storybook + TypeScript)
